## Cloning in Github Desktop

If you already have Github installed on your computer, you need to go into preferences and add a new Enterprise account. If this is the first time you installed Github, it should ask you for the login information when you first start it. 
Use the following information:

URL: https://github.rcac.purdue.edu/
Username : Your purdue account username
Password : Your purdue account password

This will allow you to view all the repositories you have been given access to. 
Go to File -> Clone Repository and you should see "beluga" in the list of repositories to be cloned.
