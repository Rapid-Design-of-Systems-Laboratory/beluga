Indirect method of optimization based on Bryson-Ho [1]_.

Controls are handled in one of two ways: ICRM [2]_ [3]_ or PMP.

Path constraints are handled in one of two ways: UTM [4]_ [5]_ [6]_ [7]_ or epsilon-trig [4]_ [5]_

Switching conditions are handled using RASHS [8]_.

.. From Mall: "use [4] for bang-bang and singular control problems"
    "Use [5] for problems with control constraints"
    "Use [6] for problems with mixed state and control constraints (q=0)"
    "Use [7] as catch-all (thesis)"
